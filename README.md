<h1>SEO QUESTIONS</h1>

<h2>1. What is Google Analytics Goals?</h2>

<p>GA goals are specific actions that allow tracking and analyzing the extent to which the web page in question achieves the set objectives.</p>
<p>A goal represents an activity carried out, called conversion, which contributes to the success of the business. It is therefore an essential tool of GA since each project must be able to count with well-defined objectives to evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The first goal should be to maximize the number of visits where at least one goal completes. Goal definition is the main step of any data analysis plan. If the objectives are configured correctly, Analytics provides critical information, such as the number of conversions and the conversion rate of the site in order to monitor the performance of marketing campaigns or activities carried out. Without this information, it is almost impossible to evaluate its effectiveness. Thanks to the goals, therefore, it is possible to have important information on the website's performance. By analyzing the conversions, it is possible to make changes to improve the conversion rate.</p>
<p>We can therefore define a goal as a counter that records how many sessions a specific action has been carried out, which in the funnel, brings the user closer to becoming a customer.</p>
<p>Goals fall into two categories. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <p>MACRO-GOALS</p>
    <li>Subscribe to the newsletter</li>
    <li>Fill in contact form</li>
    <li>Purchase of a product or service</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <p>MICRO-GOALS</p>
    <li>Viewing a video</li>
    <li>Adding a product or service to your cart</li>
    <li>Give a like or a positive vote</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. What is meant by conversions and how will you track conversions through GA?</h2>

<p>A conversion is an action that you want the users to carry out and that in general brings value, actual or potential to the online business.</p>
<p>The conversion actions are generally proportional to the goals of a site (registration on the site, product purchase, etc.). Therefore defining macro and micro objectives, you can proceed to the analysis of the performance of the site through the following means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Conversion percentage: they help to analyze how users interact with the different platforms, demographic groups and marketing channels</li>
    <li>Multi channel report: show the path that the user made in the various visits to the page until the conversion. This data is created for each goal conversion and e-commerce transaction that GA records</li>
    <li>Target flow: allows you to view and identify where there may be problems in an important step of a concrete process so as to help increase the percentage of conversion of a concrete process</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. What is meant by KPI in Analytics? Can you give some examples of KPIs?</h2>

<p>A KPI is a performance indicator used to measure the achievement of one or more goals. Of course, without setting these goals, KPIs would lose their meaning. There are multiple KPIs, therefore it is essential to choose when they meet the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>quantifiability: they are measurable and usable</li>
    <li>relevance and strong impact</li>
    <li>practicality: they integrate well with company processes</li>
    <li>directionality: they determine if your company is improving</li>
    <li>operation: if put in relation to the practical context, they measure an effective change</li>
    <li>pre-determined deadlines: since the KPIs can divide the analyzed process into different checkpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>KPIs can be considered for business or area specific. In Analytics, we can also be divided by type based on their characteristics:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Numeric KPIs: number of sessions, filling out the form in the funnel, entries, number of leads</li>
    <li>Reporting KPI: percentage of new connections, conversion rate, bounce rate</li>
</ul>

<p>By monitoring user behavior with a specific section of the site, some examples of metrics (KPI) to be considered can be the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bounce rate: the user's bounce rate</li>
    <li>Scroll rate: percentage of page scroll</li>
    <li>Time on page: how long the user has been on that content</li>
    <li>Pages per session: on average, how many pages of the site have been consulted</li>
    <li>Pageviews: how many times the page has been viewed</li>
    <li>The reputation of the domain</li>
    <li>The type: (follow y nofollow), calidad (through which medium they click on us) and number of clicks on the web</li>
    <li>Keywords: indicating the number of keywords that we believe are fundamental in order to allow users to easily meet our web</li>
    <li>Keywords Position: the positions that keywords occupy according to the objective of positioning the web in the various search engines</li>
</ul>

<p>In Analytics, based on the items selected in the left menu, the GA panel provides a summary of main metrics according to the filtered item. As can be easily deduced through a simple example, the metrics that refer to the behavior are different from those present in the conversions section.</p>
<p>In conclusion, KPIs allow not only to determine the results of a specific action or strategy, but also offer a global vision of the situation since they indicate the strong and weak points for having an overall picture of the project.</p>

<h2>4. What is Funnel in Goals?</h2>

<p>A funnel is a set of steps that a user can take within a web page until it is finalized in a purchase or conversion process. The name is dictated by the fact that at each step the number of customers is naturally decreasing. It is easy to imagine how each web has a greater number of visits than the purchases of products or services offered.</p>

<p>Therefore the funnel is the process that  help to trace the path followed by the user and find out his behavior. GA is a fundamental tool for the study of the funnel since it allows you to identify how the customer reaches our web, where the purchase process starts or where he leaves, in order to optimize the page to reach a greater number of conversions.</p>

<h2>5. Can you explain events in Google Analytics? What are the 4 components of an event?</h2>

<p>We mean Events in GA as the type of data that allows us to track user interactions with our page.</p>
<p>By default, events in GA are not set from the control panel but require a specific code configurable directly from the site. Unlike the GA code that allows you to track only the page views on the site, this code allows to know for example if a user has downloaded a pdf file rather than watched a video. All this helps to study user behavior on our page. GA always associates an action configured as an event with two basic components plus two other optional components as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Category (mandatory)</li>
    <li>Action (mandatory)</li>
    <li>Label (optional)</li>
    <li>Value (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Category and action</h3>
<p>We could easily imagine in a page of an e-commerce site, to trace all the clicks made on "calculate shipping costs". In an event it would represent an action while the purchase process would correspond to the reference category. These are therefore values ​​that we can associate based on customer behavior that allow tracing certain actions in relation to as many categories. In fact, for each category traced, GA will allow us to display metrics that count the number of shares per category.</p>

<h3>Label and value</h3>
<p>They correspond to two values ​​which, despite being optional, can be useful for having even more traceability of a given action. The label can refer to the name of a video displayed or in the specific example mentioned, the name of the product added to the cart. The value, on the other hand, corresponds to a number to be associated with the traced action such as the price of the product. We can therefore define events as selection points as a specific target for a goal, being able to reveal itself as the decisive action that defines the achievement of a goal. Together with the goals they represent two fundamental points for the tracing and subsequent analysis of the data in order to optimize the website as much as possible.</p>
